Hi!
I am glad you took an interest in me. So, I am Ahammed Sakir Nabil and am currently a PhD Student with research focused on medical AI and computer vision. My research works also include privacy and security of data through Federated Learning and what not. 

Professionally, I am a Software and Systems Engineer with expertise in platform, cloud, devops and backend engineering.

I am always open for collaborations. So if you think my experience can be handy for you, feel free to reach out on my email, but I will always prefer connecting on LinkedIn first :v
